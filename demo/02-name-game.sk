; What is this?
; * Asking the name to the user, reading it into a buffer and print it back.

; How does it work?
; * First we print the message using the syscall for writing to a file descriptor (stdout).
; * Then we read the input through stdin
; * Finally we show the message back to stdout.

; Saving "Hi, " to the buffer memory
memory 0 + 72  !8
memory 1 + 105 !8
memory 2 + 44  !8
memory 3 + 32  !8

; Asking for the name to doing a syscall to stdout fd.
"What's your name? " 1 1 sys4 drop

; Letting the user input something in stdin by doing a read syscall
; and saving it into the buffer memory.
80 memory 4 + 0 0 sys4

; Showing the results with another write syscall to std fd.
5 + memory 1 1 sys4
